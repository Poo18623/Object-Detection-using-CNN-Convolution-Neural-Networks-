Object Detection and Classification of Poses using Convolution Neural Networks

This is the Coding part of Object Detection and Classification using Convolution Neural Networks -CNN


Dataset should be images. In my Code it is different types of Yoga Poses. 
The training-1 code will take the input images from a merged csv file and keep the poses in respective folders which we should creae manually
